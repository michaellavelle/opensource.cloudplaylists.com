opensource.cloudplaylists.com
=============================

Since I launched <a href="http://cloudplaylists.com">the CloudPlaylists Beta Site</a> over 1500 people created accounts and 
have used the site to create over 2000 playlists between them.

Being a Beta site, there were many limitations, not least the aesthetics of the site which is far from ideal - I'm a server-side developer :-)

I'm looking to build the next generation site - currently deployed to <a href="http://opensource.cloudplalyists.com">http://opensource.cloudplaylists.com</a>

I've put together the skeleton HTML for the main Playlist page, Profile Page and a mockup of how an embeddable Playlist widget could look, these are 
contained within this repository.

An example playlist url where this HTML is currenty deployed can be found below:

<a href="http://opensource.cloudplaylists.com/michaellavelle/january_2013">http://opensource.cloudplaylists.com/michaellavelle/january_2013</a>

I'm wondering if any front-end developers would like to get involved, and help design the look and feel of the 
next generation Playlist sharing site?

Ideally the look and feel would be similar in style to the previous site at <a href="http://cloudplaylists.com">CloudPlaylists.com</a>.

If you'd like to get involved, please fork this repository and get in touch.

Any pull requests that are selected to be pulled back into this main repository will make their way to the opensource.cloudplaylists.com in the initial instance, to be followed
by a deployment to the main CloudPlaylists.com site once we upgrade to this new version.

Full credit will be given to anyone involved on the main home page and on the thousands of playlist pages.

We need your help to make the music listening of thousands of people a beautiful experience!

Many thanks,

Michael Lavelle
